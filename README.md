## Usage

### Basic Usage
Render Markdown with embedded LaTeX expressions:

```swift
import MDLatex

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        MarkdownLatexView(markdownContent: """
        # Title
        This is some inline math: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\).

        And a display equation:
        \[
        E = mc^2
        \]
        """)
        .themeConfiguration(
            backgroundColor: .white,
            fontColor: .black,
            fontSize: 16,
            fontFamily: "Arial",
            userInteractionEnabled: true
        )
        .animationEnabled(true, chunkRenderingDuration: 0.5)
    }
}
```

---

### Customizing the Theme
Configure the theme using the fluent API:

```swift
MarkdownLatexView(markdownContent: "# Custom Theme")
    .themeConfiguration(
        backgroundColor: .blue,
        fontColor: .white,
        fontSize: 20,
        fontFamily: "Helvetica",
        userInteractionEnabled: true
    )
```

---

### Animating Content
Enable chunk-based animations for rendering large content:

```swift
MarkdownLatexView(markdownContent: """
# Animated Content
Chunk 1...

Chunk 2...

Chunk 3...
""")
.animationEnabled(true, chunkRenderingDuration: 0.3)
```

Use `onChunkRendered` and `onComplete` for callbacks:

```swift
MarkdownLatexView(markdownContent: "Large Document")
    .onChunkRendered { chunk, index in
        print("Rendered chunk \(index): \(chunk)")
    }
    .onComplete { finalHTML in
        print("Rendering complete: \(finalHTML)")
    }
```

---

### Caching Content
Take advantage of caching in non-animated mode:

```swift
MarkdownLatexView(markdownContent: "Repeated Content")
.renderAllContentAtOnceCached()
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Markdown Parsing:** Uses [Down](https://github.com/johnxnguyen/Down) to convert Markdown into HTML.
2. **LaTeX Handling:** Extracts LaTeX expressions with a custom parser and injects them into the HTML using KaTeX.
3. **Dynamic Rendering:** Supports chunk-based or one-go rendering, depending on the animation configuration.
4. **WebView Integration:** Leverages `WKWebView` for rendering HTML and JavaScript for KaTeX rendering.

---

## Architecture

- **`AnimationConfiguration`:** Defines animation settings like duration and toggle for enabling animations.
- **`ThemeConfiguration`:** Handles theme properties like colors, font size, and font family.
- **`MarkdownLatexView`:** The main SwiftUI view for rendering Markdown and LaTeX.
- **`MarkdownLatexParser`:** A utility for extracting and reinjecting LaTeX expressions into HTML.
- **`katex_template.html`:** A prebuilt HTML template for KaTeX rendering.
